/*carefully include all .cpp files so they will get compiled in one go
for complex features, you will need to use the following trick to 
avoid recompiling a file twice.  Normally this is only done with .h files, but it can work on .cpp files as well

 #ifndef  NAME_CPP
 #define  NAME_CPP

 your code

 #endif
